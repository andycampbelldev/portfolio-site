# Portfolio Site
- Built from scratch with plain old HTML, CSS and JS (including the image carousel on the project pages - that was fun!)
- Static web pages deployed on GitHub Pages

## Planned Enhancements

- Make carousel more tolerant of different image sizes by displaying images as contained background images on the carousel slide elements.
- Add carousel pagination to show users how far through the carousel they are.
